They called the captain back to his ship.  
 reckless storm could hold a tirade against him —   
 hoisted upon the members, his brow stearns & furrows.

I shriek, “do not let him go,  
 he is a bitter man  
 the sea has taken all he has.”

But they cannot hear.  
 every dove synchronous with the ocean.  
 & at bay does the sand circle, ‘round and ‘round,  
 doomed destinies marked

I can no longer tell the difference between the ink and the tattoo.

But they called the captain back to his ship.  
 it was a broken promise else be fair.  
 hearts made crimson only by the sunset  
 bleaked whiskey, otherwise.

His lover was a quarrel, in quarantine,  
 masquerade as something painted in pink —   
 I no longer can tell by map  
 where you can drown

& where you can breathe.
