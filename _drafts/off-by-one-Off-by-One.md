      It&#8217;s a new day, only off by one. In reality, I should feel good just for the fact I&#8217;m starting a New Year&#8217;s resolution a month early. I think I&#8217;m finally going to actually finish writing 750 words for a month straight, even if it kills me.

      I see a lot of sensationalist articles titled &#8220;My year of writing 750 words every day&#8221; and it just causes me to pause for a moment in disbelief. <em>What?</em> I don&#8217;t get how people can do it, honestly. My first instinct is to call them frauds. Even with cheating, I&#8217;ve never managed over fifteen days straight. It&#8217;s shameful.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But then again, I was only sixteen when I initially started on this website, I guess patience just comes with age.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This is the difficult part now, not knowing what I&#8217;m going to write. Actual freewriting. I have to admit that after years of tuning myself to be able to write properly, in such a short amount of time, it feels almost impossible to just <em>let myself write.</em> In fact, I was up last night thinking about that after I tried to write to you yesterday.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Today, though, feels good. The sky is a warming blue in the distance. One thing I enjoy about winter is how prolonged the sunsets and sunrises become. They tease the unnatural colors of the sky.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What else is there to talk about? I got my paycheck today, I don&#8217;t know if it was a glitch or an act of kindness, but I was charged my $14-hour rate for cleaning last week instead of my usual $12-hour, which I&#8217;m pretty sure caused me to earn an extra thirty-two dollars.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Am I going to spend it wisely? Probably not. It&#8217;s pretty difficult to budget during the holidays. I already saved $500, so it shouldn&#8217;t be that big of a deal, but I&#8217;m still a bit anxious over the $200 I have to pay Danielle for our trip to Banff, and another $150 or so I&#8217;ll need for spending money.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Money, money, money. You can really tell that I&#8217;m an adult now. It&#8217;s so weird to think that every two weeks I earn hundreds of dollars and can&#8217;t seem to manage, yet I used to do fine with a fifty dollar bill once a month if I was <em>lucky</em>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      No, there are more important things. I don&#8217;t really care about money at all, just the things I can get with it. I always seem to jot down shopping lists with things I never end up getting. How badly I&#8217;d like to splurge and spend five dollars on a pair of Uniball pens. Or maybe a new coiled black-cover journal, although they seem really difficult to find.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I also seem in desperate need of a haircut. I told Danielle I was getting one on my last paycheck but never ended up doing it. I have to admit it&#8217;s getting shaggy, and I kind of need at least a trim.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What else is there to talk about? I miss Byron, I was at Danielle&#8217;s all weekend since her parents were out at the Grey Cup so I wasn&#8217;t able to see him when he came over. I did clean up the room really well for him beforehand, though.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Although the only reason I did such a good cleaning was because there&#8217;s been construction inside my apartment for the last month. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s taking them so long, construction on the outside began almost half a year ago. I should find some time to visit Byron.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What else is there to talk about? I went to the library yesterday, mainly because I didn&#8217;t want to have to deal with the awkwardness of sitting in my house waiting for a couple of hard-working guys to be done repainting the walls another dull shade of white.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      While I was there, I ended up seating myself down to read another book about memoirs after spending my last dollar on a Tim Horton&#8217;s coffee from across the street. It was actually an interesting read, comparing writing a life-story to the oral traditions of centuries ago. One thing that stuck with me the most was the author talking about how she initially got interested in the idea after volunteering to help Hospice patients write out their life stories before they died for their friends and family. To be honest, that&#8217;s definitely something that I myself would like to do.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Well, it seems that after less than half-an-hour, I actually managed to spit an entry out. Hopefully I come back to it today and actually edit for the first time in my life.

      Until a few hours from now, Brennan.

      It&#8217;s now one in the afternoon and things have been going fantastic today! I just set my laundry and now I&#8217;m gonna write a bit more.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      While procrastinating on Reddit (hah) I stumbled upon a personal productivity data collection that someone compiled using RescueTime and their custom API. I used the program in the past, but it was rendered a bit moot by the fact I could only use it on Windows, the GNU/Linux and Android versions never seemed to actually track anything for me.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I looked and found out the person who compiled the data, lo and behold, was using Linux Mint! I installed it myself and found that it works great, along with an app for my smartphone.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The kicker, though, is the fact that I managed to score six months of premium membership! I didn&#8217;t even have to do anything except fill out a survey and allow mysterious figures to conduct a study on me.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was amazing, and a bit sad, to be able to see all of the data that had been accumulated the past two years since I started using RescueTime with this e-mail. I was almost dissuaded since the majority of it was either Byron&#8217;s video games or my Mom reading Big Brother blogs. But at the same time I didn&#8217;t want to restart since I had already customized so many program categories. But guess what? You can just delete the entirety of your data. So I&#8217;m starting fresh. Clean slate.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So I&#8217;m grateful for that. I&#8217;m also grateful for the fact that I managed to score enough of the exact change I needed to do laundry, which I haven&#8217;t done for two months or so. Don&#8217;t worry, that sounds a lot grosser than it actually is.

      Today has been my best day in recent memory. I managed to finish the entire first week of an MOOC on learning how to learn or meta-learning. I took notes as well, which resulted in an additional 1,000 words to be written on top of this.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It&#8217;s amazing how it just seems like I flipped a switch, this feels like a very good beginning. I have to be cautiously optimistic.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I think what has helped me the most so far has been the app Fabulous. I&#8217;ve actually started to implement a morning routine because of it, and hopefully it can help me start an afternoon and evening one as well.
