Enjoy the pun in the title? I know, it&#8217;s terrible. And it&#8217;s terrible on multiple levels, really.

One of the most talked about rules in blogging is making a captive and quantified headline. As much as I hate it, it&#8217;s very much true. Creating [&#8216;listicles&#8217;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle), which even has its own _Wikipedia_ article, is one of the most effective and simple ways of attracting viewers.

But there&#8217;s a feeling of lost integrity when you format with such a style. And I&#8217;m not even talking about clickbait&#8230; yet. What I am talking about is when you have a list, that&#8217;s all you have. I could have titled this post &#8217;10 daily habits for insanely improved blogging&#8217;, but you lose the opportunity to expand on things outside of that. You lose the opportunity to story-tell, which is the entire point of creating a blog.

Of course, the irony (even double standard) arises when you look at the story I&#8217;m telling here; it&#8217;s nothing original or new. The above is really just a thinly-veiled complaint that&#8217;s been stated, with better articulation, by others.
